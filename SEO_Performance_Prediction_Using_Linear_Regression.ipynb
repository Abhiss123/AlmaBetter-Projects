It predicts one variable (the outcome, called the **dependent variable**) based on the value of another variable **(the independent variable).** Imagine you want to predict your SEO performance **(like how many visitors a webpage gets)** based on another factor like **how much money you spend on ads.** **Linear regression helps you find a straight-line relationship between these two things.** It tries to figure out how much the dependent variable **(SEO performance)** changes when the independent variable **(ad spend)** changes.\n",
