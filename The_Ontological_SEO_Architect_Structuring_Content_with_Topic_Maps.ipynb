        "\n",
        "1. **Identifies Important Keywords**:\n",
        "   - Extracts words or phrases that are frequently used across multiple pages on the website.\n",
        "   - Groups them into a structured format to show their relationships, frequency, and importance.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Keyword Name**:\n",
        "   - Each main entry represents a **keyword** or **topic** found on the website.\n",
        "   - Example: `\"ppc\"` represents \"Pay-Per-Click\" advertising.\n",

        "2. **Identify Content Gaps**:\n",
        "   - Look at low-frequency, related terms to find opportunities for new content.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Refine Pages**:\n",
        "   - Use the `sourceURLs` to locate pages where a keyword is mentioned.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### **Explanation:**\n",
        "1. **What are Categories?**\n",
        "   - Categories group similar or related words/terms from the content.\n",
        "   - Example: In **Category_1**, terms like \"home\", \"years\", \"journey\" are grouped because they share a common context, such as website navigation or user experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Why Are They Grouped?**\n",
        "   - Grouping terms helps identify key themes or topics covered in the content.\n",
        "   - It makes it easier to see which topics are well-covered and which need improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **How to Use This?**\n",
        "   - Analyze the words in each category to determine if they align with the intended focus of your content.\n",

        "#### **Explanation:**\n",
        "1. **Metrics Explained:**\n",
        "   - **Relevance**:\n",
        "     - Measures how important or meaningful the terms in this category are to your overall content goals.\n",
        "     - A low score (e.g., 0.01) means the category is not very aligned with the website's focus.\n",
        "   - **Coverage**:\n",
        "     - Indicates how well the category's topics are addressed in the content.\n",
        "     - A low score (e.g., 0.01) suggests that many related terms/topics are missing or underrepresented.\n",
        "   - **Actionability**:\n",
        "     - Measures how easy it is to take action to improve the category.\n",
        "     - A high score (e.g., 0.80) means the category can be improved with relatively simple updates or additions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Why Are These Metrics Important?**\n",
        "   - They help you understand the strengths and weaknesses of your content.\n",
        "   - For example, a category with low relevance but high actionability means it’s easy to adjust the content to make it more relevant.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **How to Use This?**\n",
        "   - Focus on categories with low relevance or coverage but high actionability. These are the easiest wins to improve your content.\n",

        "     ```html\n",
        "     <script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n",

        "     ```\n",

        "3. **Test the Schema Markup:**\n",
        "   - Use Google’s [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) to validate the Schema Markup and ensure there are no errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Deploy to Live Website:**\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Improved Search Engine Understanding:**\n",
        "   - Schema Markup provides detailed information about the content of your webpage. For example, it can tell Google that the webpage is an article, product, or FAQ.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Rich Snippets:**\n",
        "   - Proper Schema Markup can result in enhanced search results, such as:\n",
        "     - Ratings (e.g., stars for a product or service).\n",
        "     - FAQs displayed directly in search results.\n",
        "     - Additional links or details like event dates or prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Higher Click-Through Rates (CTR):**\n",
        "   - Rich snippets stand out on the search engine results page (SERP), making users more likely to click on your link.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Increased Visibility:**\n",
