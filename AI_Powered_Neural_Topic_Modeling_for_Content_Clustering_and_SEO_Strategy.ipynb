        "\n",
        "### **Project Purpose:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of the **AI-Powered Neural Topic Modeling for Content Clustering and SEO Strategy** project is to use advanced **AI technology** (specifically **Neural Topic Modeling**) to help website owners understand their content better. The project aims to:\n",
        "1. **Automatically organize content** into meaningful groups (called clusters) based on the topics being discussed.\n",
        "2. **Improve the website's SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** by identifying the best keywords and linking similar pages together to boost visibility in search engine rankings.\n",
        "3. **Recommend similar content** to users, helping them easily find other relevant pages on the website.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s break down each part in simple language:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Neural Topic Modeling (NTM):**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Neural Topic Modeling** is an advanced method that uses **AI** to analyze large amounts of text (like the content on a website) and automatically discover hidden **topics** within that text. Topics are the main themes or subjects that appear frequently in the content.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if your website has articles about **SEO**, **digital marketing**, and **web development**, the NTM will automatically find these themes by analyzing the words used in each article. It’s like AI reading all your content and figuring out the key subjects your website is talking about.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Content Clustering:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the **NTM** identifies the topics, the project groups similar content together, which is called **content clustering**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it this way: If you have several articles about **SEO strategies**, this project will automatically **cluster** those articles into a group. Another cluster might include articles on **social media marketing**. This helps organize the website's content into clear, meaningful groups. This makes it easier for users to navigate your website and find the information they’re looking for.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why is this useful?**\n",
        "- It helps users by showing them related articles or services they might be interested in.\n",
        "- It helps website owners keep their content well-organized and easy to manage.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **SEO Strategy: How does it help SEO?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**SEO** (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of improving a website’s ranking on search engines like Google. When your website ranks higher, more people find it when they search for related terms. The project uses **Neural Topic Modeling** to help with SEO in two ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Keyword Strategy**: The project identifies the most important **keywords** for each topic. These keywords are what people are likely to type into search engines. For example, if the NTM finds that \"SEO services\" and \"link-building\" are common topics, you can focus on these keywords to attract more traffic from search engines.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Internal Linking**: The project finds which pages are similar to each other. You can use this information to **create links** between similar pages. Internal linking is important for SEO because it helps search engines understand the structure of your website, making it easier to index your pages and boost your rankings.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Recommendation System: What does it do?**\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to organizing content and improving SEO, the project also acts as a **recommendation system**. When someone reads an article or visits a page on your website, the project can suggest other **similar pages** that the user might be interested in based on the content they are viewing.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if someone is reading about **SEO strategies**, the project can recommend other related pages like **link-building techniques** or **competitor keyword analysis**. This keeps visitors engaged with your website for longer and increases the chances of them exploring more of your content.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **How Does This Help a Website Owner?**\n",
        "\n",
        "As a website owner, the project helps you in the following ways:\n",
        "- **Content Clustering**: It automatically organizes your website's content, saving you time and effort in manually managing pages.\n",
        "- **SEO Optimization**: By showing you the most important keywords and helping you link similar content, it improves your website’s visibility in search engines, attracting more visitors.\n",
        "- **User Engagement**: The recommendation system keeps users engaged by suggesting relevant content, which helps improve the user experience and increase the time visitors spend on your site.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of How It Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s say you own a website that offers various digital marketing services. You have pages on:\n",
        "- **SEO services**\n",
        "- **Social media marketing**\n",
        "- **Link-building techniques**\n",
        "- **Content proofreading**\n",
        "\n",
        "Using this project:\n",
        "1. **Neural Topic Modeling** analyzes all your pages and discovers that the main topics are **SEO**, **social media**, and **content services**.\n",
        "2. The project **clusters** these pages into meaningful groups (like all SEO-related pages together, all social media marketing pages together, etc.).\n",
        "3. It suggests the best **keywords** for each topic (like \"SEO services\" for SEO-related pages) so that you can optimize your content for search engines.\n",
        "4. It shows you which pages are similar, so you can **link** them together (for example, linking **SEO services** to **competitor keyword analysis**).\n",
        "5. It provides a list of **recommended pages** for users to see based on the content they are currently viewing, helping them discover more content on your site.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Benefits for Website Owners:\n",
        "- **Save time** by automating the content organization process.\n",
        "- **Improve SEO** by identifying the most important keywords and linking related content.\n",
        "- **Increase user engagement** by providing page recommendations and keeping users on the site longer.\n",

        "### **What is Neural Topic Modeling (NTM)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Neural Topic Modeling combines traditional topic modeling techniques (like Latent Dirichlet Allocation, LDA) with neural networks. Topic modeling is a process that discovers hidden topics or themes within a large collection of text data. Neural Topic Modeling enhances this by using deep learning (neural networks) to identify complex, nuanced topics in the content, improving the accuracy of topic discovery.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Use Cases of Neural Topic Modeling:**\n",
        "- **Content Organization:** Automatically organize content into topics, making it easier for websites to create clusters or groups of related articles.\n",
        "- **SEO Optimization:** NTM helps in finding hidden themes within your website content, which can guide your keyword strategy to target the right search terms.\n",
        "- **Recommendation Systems:** E-commerce or content websites can use NTM to recommend relevant products or articles to users based on topic similarities.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Real-Life Implementations:**\n",
        "- **Customer Reviews Analysis:** E-commerce sites use NTM to analyze customer reviews and discover the hidden topics (e.g., \"shipping,\" \"quality,\" or \"price\") that matter most to customers.\n",
        "- **News Websites:** News websites use NTM to group related news articles automatically and create content clusters.\n",
        "- **Search Engines:** Search engines can enhance their understanding of queries by categorizing content into more nuanced topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How is NTM used on Websites?**\n",
        "\n",
        "For your project related to a website, Neural Topic Modeling can be used to analyze the text content of the website and help group related pages or articles into topics. This is great for:\n",
        "- **Optimizing SEO and Keywords:** NTM will find the best hidden topics in your content, which can be used to improve your website’s search engine ranking.\n",
        "- **Content Clustering:** You can create groups of related content on the website that users will find easier to navigate and explore.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What kind of data does NTM need?\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Text Data:** NTM needs a lot of text data to analyze. For your website project, this would be the written content on each page of the website (articles, blogs, descriptions, etc.).\n",
        "- **Input Formats:** This text data can come from URLs of the webpages or be provided in CSV format. If you use URLs, you need to scrape or extract the text content from those webpages. If you have the content in CSV format, the text should be in a structured way (e.g., with a column for the page title and a column for the text content).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### How does NTM work technically?\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Preprocessing the Data:** The text needs to be cleaned first (removing stopwords like \"the,\" \"is,\" etc.). Then, it converts the text into numbers using a process called \"vectorization\" so the neural network can understand it.\n",
        "- **Neural Network and Topic Discovery:** The neural network processes the text data and uncovers hidden topics by analyzing patterns in the text. Traditional models like LDA focus on simpler topics, while NTM goes deeper into complex patterns and relationships.\n",
        "- **Output:** After processing, NTM outputs a list of topics (keywords that represent each topic) along with their associated content. For your website, this means the model will tell you the main themes in the website’s content and how they are related, which can guide your content strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why is NTM helpful for content clustering and keyword strategies?\n",
        "\n",
        "By discovering hidden topics, NTM helps:\n",
        "- **Optimize Content Clusters:** It groups related content together, improving the user experience on your website.\n",
        "- **Enhance Keyword Strategy:** The topics uncovered by NTM can guide which keywords or search terms are most relevant to your website's content, improving SEO.\n",

        "  - `requests.get(url)` sends an HTTP request to the website server and tries to download the webpage's content.\n",
        "  - The response from the server is stored in the variable `response`. This contains the HTML content of the webpage.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Example**:\n",
        "  - For the URL `https://thatware.co/`, this sends a request to the server hosting the **ThatWare** website. The response will contain the HTML code for the homepage.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Parse the HTML content**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "            soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Explanation**:\n",
        "  - The `BeautifulSoup` object `soup` parses the HTML content (which is in `response.content`) and allows us to work with it as a structured document.\n",
        "  - `html.parser` is a built-in HTML parser that helps break down the HTML into meaningful elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Example**:\n",
        "  - The `BeautifulSoup` library will now read through the HTML from `https://thatware.co/` and allow us to extract text from the page, ignoring the HTML tags (like `<div>`, `<h1>`, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. **Extract visible text from the webpage**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "            text = soup.get_text(separator=' ')\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Explanation**:\n",
        "  - `soup.get_text(separator=' ')` extracts all the visible text from the webpage (without HTML tags). The `separator=' '` argument ensures that different blocks of text are separated by spaces.\n",
        "  - The result is a long string containing all the visible text on the page, with spaces between different sections.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Explanation**:\n",
        "  - The `try` block ensures that if something goes wrong (e.g., the webpage cannot be reached, or the URL is incorrect), the `except` block will handle it.\n",
        "  - It prints an error message that includes the URL that caused the error and a description of the error (`str(e)`).\n",

        "stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))  # Get default English stopwords from nltk\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **Explanation**:\n",
        "  - The `stopwords.words('english')` gets a list of common English words that are not useful for analysis (like “the,” “is,” “and”).\n",
        "  - These words are called **stopwords**, and they don’t help when you are trying to understand the main ideas or topics in a document.\n",
        "  - `set(stopwords.words('english'))` stores these stopwords in a **set** (which is a type of collection that makes checking for words faster).\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Why this is important**:\n",
        "  - Removing these common words helps us focus on the more important and meaningful words in the text.\n",

        "```\n",
        "- **Explanation**:\n",
        "  - **`CountVectorizer`** is a tool from the `scikit-learn` library that helps convert text into numbers by counting how many times each word appears.\n",
        "  - We are creating a **vectorizer** object here, which will be used to transform the text into a matrix of word counts.\n",
        "  \n",
        "Let’s break down the parameters used in `CountVectorizer`:\n",
        "  - **`max_df=0.9`**: This means we will ignore words that appear in more than 90% of the documents (webpages). If a word appears almost everywhere, it’s probably not very meaningful (e.g., \"service\" might appear on every page).\n",
        "  - **`min_df=2`**: This means we will ignore words that appear in fewer than 2 documents. This helps remove rare or unusual words that don’t add much value to the analysis.\n",
        "  - **`stop_words='english'`**: This is an additional safety measure to remove common English stopwords like \"the,\" \"and,\" \"is.\" Even though we removed stopwords in the previous step, this ensures that any missed stopwords are removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Why this is important**:\n",
        "  - The `CountVectorizer` tool transforms the text into a **Bag of Words** model, which is basically a big table showing how often each word appears in each document (webpage). This table is the numerical format that the machine learning model can work with.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Fit and Transform the Preprocessed Text**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "word_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(preprocessed_content)\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **Explanation**:\n",
        "  - The **`fit_transform`** method does two things:\n",
        "    1. **Fit**: It looks at the preprocessed text and learns which unique words are present across all the webpages. It creates a vocabulary of these words.\n",
        "    2. **Transform**: It then counts how many times each word appears in each document (webpage) and puts that information into a matrix (a grid of numbers).\n",
        "  - The result is a **matrix** where:\n",
        "    - Each row represents a webpage.\n",
        "    - Each column represents a unique word.\n",
        "    - The numbers in the matrix show how many times a word appears on a particular webpage.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Why this is important**:\n",
        "  - This step transforms the text into a format (numbers) that a machine learning model can work with. Without converting text to numbers, the model wouldn’t be able to understand or process it.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Return the Vectorizer and Word Matrix**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "return vectorizer, word_matrix\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **Explanation**:\n",
        "  - The function returns two things:\n",
        "    1. **`vectorizer`**: This is the `CountVectorizer` object that knows the vocabulary (the list of words it found) and can be used later for further analysis.\n",
        "    2. **`word_matrix`**: This is the matrix of word counts for each document (webpage), which will be used in the next steps of the analysis.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Why this is important**:\n",
        "  - The `vectorizer` object helps us keep track of the words (vocabulary), and the `word_matrix` is the actual data we need to perform further analysis, such as topic modeling or similarity calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Happens in This Step?\n",
        "\n",
        "In this step, we are turning our cleaned text into **numbers** so that it can be used in machine learning models. Specifically, we are creating a **Bag of Words model**, which is like a big table where:\n",
        "- Each row is a webpage.\n",
        "- Each column is a word.\n",
        "- The numbers in the table represent how many times each word appears in each webpage.\n",
        "\n",
        "This conversion is crucial because computers can only process numbers—not raw text—so the text has to be transformed into a numerical format before any further analysis can be done.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### Example of How It Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s say we have two cleaned documents (webpages):\n",
        "1. `\"seo services digital marketing best results\"`\n",
        "2. `\"learn digital marketing tips seo experts\"`\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Rows**: Each row represents a document (or webpage).\n",
        "- **Columns**: Each column represents a unique word that appears in the documents.\n",
        "- **Numbers**: The numbers in the table show how many times a word appears in each document.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "- The word **\"seo\"** appears **1 time** in both Doc1 and Doc2.\n",
        "- The word **\"services\"** appears **1 time** in Doc1 and **0 times** in Doc2.\n",

        "I’ve gone through each word of your question to ensure that I understand exactly what you’re asking. You want me to explain the **`create_topic_model`** function in very simple terms, so that even someone without a technical background can understand it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Does This Function Do?\n",
        "\n",
        "The **`create_topic_model`** function builds a **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** topic model, which is a tool that discovers the **hidden topics** within a collection of documents. In this case, the documents are the webpages you are analyzing. The function does this by:\n",
        "1. **Tokenizing** the text (splitting it into words).\n",
        "2. **Creating a dictionary** (mapping each word to a unique ID).\n",
        "3. **Creating a Bag of Words (BoW) corpus** (counting how many times each word appears in each document).\n",
        "4. **Building the LDA model** to find hidden topics based on the words and their frequencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step-by-Step Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Define the Function**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def create_topic_model(preprocessed_content, num_topics=5):\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **Explanation**:\n",
        "  - This function, `create_topic_model`, takes two inputs:\n",
        "    - **`preprocessed_content`**: A list of cleaned text from the webpages (the output from the previous steps).\n",
        "    - **`num_topics=5`**: The number of topics you want the model to find. In this case, it’s set to 5 by default, but you can change this to find more or fewer topics.\n",
        "  - The goal is to discover **the most common themes (topics)** across the documents (webpages).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Tokenize the Preprocessed Content**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "tokenized_data = [text.split() for text in preprocessed_content]\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **Explanation**:\n",
        "  - **Tokenization** is the process of splitting text into individual words (tokens). This line goes through each cleaned document and splits it into words.\n",
        "  - For example, the sentence \"seo services digital marketing\" becomes `['seo', 'services', 'digital', 'marketing']`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Why this is important**:\n",
        "  - Tokenizing the text is necessary because the topic model needs to look at individual words to find patterns and topics. Without splitting the text into words, the model wouldn't be able to analyze the content properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Create a Dictionary**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(tokenized_data)\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **Explanation**:\n",
        "  - A **dictionary** is created from the tokenized data using the `corpora.Dictionary` function from the `gensim` library.\n",
        "  - This dictionary assigns a unique **ID** to every word in the text. For example:\n",
        "    - \"seo\" might be assigned ID 0,\n",
        "    - \"services\" might be assigned ID 1, and so on.\n",
        "  - The dictionary helps the model understand which words are present in your documents and how frequently they appear.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Why this is important**:\n",
        "  - The dictionary is like a map that connects each word to its unique ID, which is necessary for the LDA model to process the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Convert the Tokenized Data into a Bag of Words Corpus**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(text) for text in tokenized_data]\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **Explanation**:\n",
        "  - This step converts each document into a **Bag of Words (BoW) representation**.\n",
        "  - The **Bag of Words** model creates a list of word IDs and their frequencies (how many times each word appears) for each document.\n",
        "  - For example, the document `\"seo services digital marketing\"` might become:\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)]\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    - Here, the number `0` represents \"seo\", and `1` indicates that it appears once in the document.\n",
        "    - The number `1` represents \"services\", and it also appears once.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Why this is important**:\n",
        "  - The Bag of Words corpus is how the LDA model understands each document. Instead of raw text, the model works with word IDs and frequencies. This allows it to find which words often appear together and therefore uncover topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. **Create the LDA Topic Model**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "lda_model = models.LdaModel(corpus, num_topics=num_topics, id2word=dictionary, passes=10)\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **Explanation**:\n",
        "  - This line creates the **LDA model** using the `LdaModel` function from `gensim`.\n",
        "  - The **LDA model** tries to find hidden topics in the documents by analyzing which words often appear together.\n",
        "  - The parameters used are:\n",
        "    - **`corpus`**: This is the Bag of Words representation of your documents.\n",
        "    - **`num_topics=num_topics`**: The number of topics you want to discover (set to 5 by default).\n",
        "    - **`id2word=dictionary`**: The dictionary that maps word IDs to the actual words.\n",
        "    - **`passes=10`**: This tells the model how many times it should go through the data to find the topics. More passes mean the model has more opportunities to refine its understanding of the topics.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Why this is important**:\n",
        "  - The LDA model is the core part of the topic discovery process. It analyzes the word patterns in the documents to find groups of words that tend to appear together, which represent the hidden topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of How It Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s say you have two preprocessed documents:\n",
        "1. `\"seo services digital marketing\"`\n",
        "2. `\"learn digital marketing seo tips\"`\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Tokenization**:\n",
        "   - Document 1 becomes: `['seo', 'services', 'digital', 'marketing']`\n",
        "   - Document 2 becomes: `['learn', 'digital', 'marketing', 'seo', 'tips']`\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Create a Dictionary**:\n",
        "   - The dictionary assigns an ID to each unique word:\n",
        "     - `'seo'`: ID 0\n",
        "     - `'services'`: ID 1\n",
        "     - `'digital'`: ID 2\n",
        "     - `'marketing'`: ID 3\n",
        "     - `'learn'`: ID 4\n",
        "     - `'tips'`: ID 5\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Convert to Bag of Words (BoW)**:\n",
        "   - Document 1 (BoW): `[(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)]` (this means \"seo\" appears once, \"services\" once, etc.)\n",
        "   - Document 2 (BoW): `[(0, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)]`\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Create the LDA Model**:\n",
        "   - The LDA model analyzes the words and tries to group them into 5 topics (since `num_topics=5` is set by default). After analyzing which words appear together, it creates topics.\n",
        "\n",

        "- You can now explore the topics that the LDA model has discovered and see which words are important for each topic.\n",

The result is a list that shows which topics are most important for each page.\n",

        "### What Does This Function Do?\n",
        "\n",
        "The **`recommend_similar_pages`** function takes a list of URLs and their associated **topic distributions** (which topics are present on each page and to what extent) and then calculates how similar each page is to the others. Based on this similarity, it generates **recommendations** for each page, showing the **most similar pages**. This is useful for content recommendation systems or suggesting internal links on a website.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step-by-Step Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Define the Function**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def recommend_similar_pages(urls, page_topics, num_topics):\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **Explanation**:\n",
        "  - The function `recommend_similar_pages` takes three inputs:\n",
        "    1. **`urls`**: This is a list of URLs of the webpages that you want to analyze.\n",
        "    2. **`page_topics`**: This is a list of topic distributions for each page (which topics are present on each webpage and how much).\n",
        "    3. **`num_topics`**: This is the total number of topics that were identified by the LDA model.\n",
        "  - The goal of this function is to find out which pages are **most similar** based on their topic distributions and provide human-readable recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Create an Empty Matrix to Store Topic Distributions**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "topic_vectors = np.zeros((len(page_topics), num_topics))\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **Explanation**:\n",
        "  - Here, we are creating an empty matrix (a grid of numbers) called **`topic_vectors`** using the `numpy` library (`np`). This matrix will store the **topic distribution** for each page.\n",
        "  - The matrix will have:\n",
        "    - **Rows**: Each row represents a webpage (the number of rows will be the same as the number of webpages in `page_topics`).\n",
        "    - **Columns**: Each column represents a topic (the number of columns will be the same as the number of topics in `num_topics`).\n",
        "  - This matrix will be filled in the next step to show how much of each topic is present on each webpage.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Why this is important**:\n",
        "  - The matrix will allow us to store and compare the topic distributions for each webpage in a structured way, which is necessary for calculating the similarity between pages.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Fill in the Topic Distributions for Each Page**:\n",

        "    for topic_num, topic_value in topics:\n",
        "        topic_vectors[i, topic_num] = topic_value\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **Explanation**:\n",
        "  - This loop goes through each page and fills the **`topic_vectors`** matrix with the topic distribution data.\n",
        "  - **`enumerate(page_topics)`**: This gives us both the index (`i`, which represents the page number) and the topic distribution (`topics`) for each page.\n",
        "  - For each page (`i`), we go through its **topic distribution** (`topics`). The distribution contains pairs of numbers:\n",
        "    - **`topic_num`**: The topic number (like Topic 0, Topic 1, etc.).\n",
        "    - **`topic_value`**: The percentage or score of how much this topic is present in the page (e.g., 0.5 means 50% of the page is about this topic).\n",
        "  - We fill the **`topic_vectors`** matrix so that for each page, the appropriate value for each topic is stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Why this is important**:\n",
        "  - This step makes sure that each page’s topic distribution is stored in a way that allows us to compare pages based on their topic similarity.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Calculate the Cosine Similarity Between Pages**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(topic_vectors)\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **Explanation**:\n",
        "  - Now that the **`topic_vectors`** matrix is filled with topic distributions, we calculate the **similarity** between all pages using **cosine similarity**.\n",
        "  - **`cosine_similarity(topic_vectors)`**: This function calculates how similar two pages are based on their topic distributions. The similarity is measured on a scale from 0 to 1:\n",
        "    - A score of **1** means the pages are **very similar** (discussing almost the same topics).\n",
        "    - A score of **0** means the pages are **completely different** (discussing unrelated topics).\n",
        "  - The result is a **`similarity_matrix`**, which shows how similar each pair of pages is.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Why this is important**:\n",
        "  - Cosine similarity helps us understand which pages are discussing similar topics. This is essential for creating recommendations based on the content of the pages.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. **Create a Dictionary to Store the Recommendations**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "recommendations = {}\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **Explanation**:\n",
        "  - This line creates an empty dictionary called **`recommendations`**, which will store the **most similar pages** for each URL.\n",
        "  - The dictionary will have:\n",
        "    - **Keys**: The URLs of the pages.\n",
        "    - **Values**: A list of the most similar pages and their similarity scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Why this is important**:\n",
        "  - We need to store the recommendations for each page in a format that is easy to read and use. The dictionary will store the top 3 most similar pages for each URL.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",

        "            similar_pages.append((urls[j], similarity_score))\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **Explanation**:\n",
        "  - This part of the code loops through each webpage (`i`) and compares it to every other webpage (`j`) to find the most similar ones.\n",
        "  - **`if i != j`**: This ensures that the page does not recommend itself. We want to find other pages that are similar, not recommend the same page.\n",
        "  - **`similarity_score = similarity_matrix[i][j]`**: This gets the similarity score between page `i` and page `j`.\n",
        "  - The most similar pages and their scores are stored in **`similar_pages`**, which will be sorted in the next step.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Why this is important**:\n",
        "  - This loop compares each page to all the others and collects the similarity scores, which are necessary for creating meaningful recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 7. **Sort and Keep the Top 3 Most Similar Pages**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "similar_pages = sorted(similar_pages, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n",
        "recommendations[urls[i]] = similar_pages[:3]\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **Explanation**:\n",
        "  - **`sorted(similar_pages, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)`**: This sorts the similar pages by their similarity score (from highest to lowest). The **`x[1]`** refers to the similarity score in each tuple (URL, similarity score).\n",
        "  - **`similar_pages[:3]`**: After sorting, this keeps only the top 3 most similar pages for each URL.\n",
        "  - These top 3 similar pages are then stored in the **`recommendations`** dictionary for the current page (`urls[i]`).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Why this is important**:\n",
        "  - We don’t want to overwhelm the user with too many recommendations, so we limit the suggestions to the top 3 most similar pages. This ensures the recommendations are useful and focused.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of How It Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s say we have 4 webpages:\n",
        "- URL 1: \"SEO strategies\"\n",
        "- URL 2: \"Social media marketing\"\n",

        "\n",
        "This output is the result of running a **Neural Topic Modeling (NTM)** model on the website’s content, and it shows two main things:\n",
        "1. **Topics Discovered on The Website**: The model has identified the main topics discussed across the website pages and displays the top 10 keywords that define each topic.\n",
        "2. **Similar Pages Recommendations**: For each page on the website, the model shows the **most similar pages** (based on content) and assigns them a **similarity score** between 0 and 1. A score of **1.00** means the pages are very similar, while lower scores indicate less similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s now break down the two parts of the output in more detail.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Part 1: Topics Discovered on The Website\n",
        "\n",
        "The first part of the output lists the **top 5 topics** discovered from The website’s content. Each topic shows the **top 10 keywords** associated with it.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "```\n",
        "Topic 0 - Top 10 Keywords: 0.047*\"seo\" + 0.030*\"services\" + 0.017*\"marketing\" + 0.011*\"link\" + 0.010*\"digital\" + 0.010*\"website\" + 0.009*\"content\" + 0.009*\"building\" + 0.008*\"advanced\" + 0.007*\"business\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\n",
        "- **Topic 0** contains the words “seo,” “services,” “marketing,” and “link,” which means this topic is related to **SEO services and digital marketing**. The numbers (like 0.047) next to the words represent the importance of the keyword in that topic (higher numbers mean the word is more relevant to the topic).\n",
        "- Each topic is a **hidden theme** that your website content is addressing. Other topics could be about **web development**, **content editing**, or **social media marketing**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Use Case**:\n",
        "- By understanding the key topics that the website covers, you can **optimize your content**. For example, if you are targeting SEO services, you can ensure that your content for **SEO** is well-organized and aligned with these keywords to improve **search engine rankings**.\n",
        "  \n",
        "**What You Should Do**:\n",
        "- **Enhance your content** around the keywords shown in each topic. This will help you strengthen your SEO strategy. For instance, if your website’s main topic is about SEO, make sure to frequently use keywords like “SEO,” “services,” “link,” and “marketing” in relevant sections of your website.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Part 2: Similar Pages Recommendations\n",
        "\n",
        "This part of the output provides recommendations for each webpage on the site, showing which pages are most similar based on the content. The output gives you the **top 3 similar pages** for each page, along with a **similarity score**.\n",

        "#### Example:\n",
        "```\n",

        "  - **‘https://thatware.co/link-building-services/’** with a similarity score of **1.00**.\n",
        "  - **‘https://thatware.co/digital-marketing-services/’** with a similarity score of **1.00**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What Does the Similarity Score Mean?**\n",
        "- The **similarity score** ranges from **0 to 1**. A score of **1.00** means the two pages are very similar in terms of content. A lower score (e.g., **0.05**) means the pages are less similar.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Use Case**:\n",
        "- These recommendations tell you **which pages are closely related** in content. You can use this information to:\n",
        "  1. **Create internal links** between similar pages to improve user navigation and SEO.\n",
        "  2. **Group similar content together** into clusters (e.g., creating a category for “SEO services” that includes all similar pages).\n",
        "  3. **Cross-promote** content: You can suggest or recommend similar pages to users to keep them on your site for longer.\n",

        "### Step-by-Step Example of What to Do Next\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s a guide to what steps you should take after receiving this output:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Optimize Website Content Based on Topics**\n",
        "   - Look at the **topics** that the model has discovered (like Topic 0, Topic 1, etc.). These topics represent the key areas your website covers. For each topic, focus on the **top keywords**.\n",
        "   - For example, if Topic 0 is about SEO services, **revise and expand your content** to include more in-depth articles or sections on SEO services, link-building, and digital marketing.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Use Similar Pages for Internal Linking**\n",
        "   - For each page on your site, the model has recommended the **top 3 most similar pages**. You should:\n",
        "     - **Link these similar pages together** within your website. For example, on the page 'https://thatware.co/', you can add internal links to 'https://thatware.co/competitor-keyword-analysis/' and 'https://thatware.co/link-building-services/'.\n",
        "     - This helps users navigate your site easily and improves your website’s **SEO** because search engines like websites that are well-linked internally.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Create Content Clusters**\n",
        "   - Group pages that are highly similar into **content clusters** or **categories**. For example, if the pages 'https://thatware.co/' and 'https://thatware.co/link-building-services/' are highly similar, consider grouping them under a category like **“SEO Services”**.\n",
        "   - This will make your website more organized and **user-friendly**.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Cross-Promote Content**\n",
        "   - Use the similarity information to **cross-promote content**. For example, if a user is reading the page on **digital marketing services**, you can recommend related content like the **link-building services** page to keep them engaged with your website longer.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Actions for Client\n",
        "1. **Say to Your Client**: \"We’ve discovered that the main topics on your site are SEO, services, web development, and marketing. To improve SEO, we need to make sure these keywords are frequently used and create content around these topics.\"\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Guide Your Client**: \"Based on the recommendations, we should create internal links between the most similar pages. For example, on the **SEO services page**, we’ll link to the **competitor keyword analysis page** and the **link-building services page** to help users find related content and improve search rankings.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **For Growth**: \"We’ll group similar pages together under categories like **SEO Services** and **Content Marketing**. This will help users easily find the information they need and keep them on the website longer.\"\n",
